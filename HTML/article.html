            So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled 
            part of Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type specimen book.
            It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in the 1960s,
            although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal type samples. So far
            he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the popularity of Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory 
            that the filler text has been used for centuries.

            Don't bother typing “lorem ipsum” into Google translate. If you already tried, you may have gotten anything from "NATO" to 
            "China", depending on how you capitalized the letters. The bizarre translation was fodder for conspiracy theories, but 
            Google has since updated its “lorem ipsum” translation to, boringly enough, “lorem ipsum”.One brave soul did take a stab at translating the almost-not-quite-Latin. According to The Guardian, 
            Jaspreet Singh Boparai undertook the challenge with the goal of making the text “precisely as incoherent in English as 
            it is in Latin - and to make it incoherent in the same way”. As a result, “the Greek 'eu' in Latin became the French 
            'bien' [...] and the '-ing' ending in 'lorem ipsum' seemed best rendered by an '-iendum' in English.”
        </p>

            Nick Richardson described the translation “like extreme Mallarmé, or a Burroughsian cut-up, or a paragraph of Finnegans 
            Wake. Bits of it have surprising power: the desperate insistence on loving and pursuing sorrow, for instance, that is 
            cheated out of its justification – an incomplete object that has been either fished for, or wished for.
